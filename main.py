# Conways game of life - Python

# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
# These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
# Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
# All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
